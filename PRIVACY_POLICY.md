## 1. Introduction

RocketRAM ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our desktop application ("the Software").

## 2. Information We Do NOT Collect

**RocketRAM is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do NOT:**

## 3. Local-Only Processing

**All processing occurs locally on your computer:**

- All system monitoring data is processed in real-time and never stored or transmitted
- All optimization operations are performed locally
- Settings and preferences are stored only on your local device

## 7. Updates

If you enable automatic updates:
